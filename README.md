# Clingo3to4
This is a wrapper for the F2LP preprocessor which is a part of the cplus2asp Toolchain. 
F2LP outputs code in the older ASP syntax which is not compatible with the current ASP Core 2 specifications and thus clingo4 cannot be used as the solver (available here https://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clingo/). This wrapper takes in F2LP ouput as it's input and outputs a Logic Program file with syntax that is compatible with the ASP Core 2 specifications and can be used as an input for Clingo4. This module is currently being used in the Cplus2ASP toolchain and therefore its limited to converting clingo3 code that is output from f2lp. For general clingo3 programs this software should be used with caution and might generate wrong output.
